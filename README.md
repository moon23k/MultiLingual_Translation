# seqGAN

<br>

## Intro
---
Codes within this repo cover implementation of seqGAN.

SeqGAN is an approach that applies GAN to NLP Task through Reinforcement Learning.

<br>

## Model Architecture
---
Just like in GAN, seqGAN also consists of generator and discriminator.

Only Difference between GAN and seqGAN lies in Adversarial Training Process.


### Generator
Generator generates a series of sequence in a way the model trained through its training session.

### Discriminator
Discriminator determine the difference between real and generated data

### Policy Gradient
